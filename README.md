MUN_Site
========

The GitHub site for all work on the project. 
Revisions are kept here, only commit files after the changes have been agreed upon. 
Until said time, keep the changes, if they are successful saved in your local folder, please. 
This will ensure that the version-control won't be contaminated and lost.
The final code will stay on here. Only invite those that we have agreed to be allowed to work on the website.
